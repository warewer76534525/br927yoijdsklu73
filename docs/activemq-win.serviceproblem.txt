had this same problem on Windows Server 2008 when running as a service. It seems to be related to a problem in determing or creating the temp folder that Jetty needs. The "work" folder is one of the locations that Jetty looks for, so I resolved this problem by creating a "work" folder here: 

{amq-home}/bin/win32
